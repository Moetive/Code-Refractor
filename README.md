Code Refracter Assignment
I tried using html semantic tags and elements to keep the website more up to date
The whole purpose of this assignment/homework is to update the current code without changing what it does

WHEN YOU view the source code
YOU WILL find semantic HTML elements
WHEN YOU view the structure of the HTML elements
YOU WILL find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN YOU view the icon and image elements
YOU WILL find accessible alt attributes
WHEN YOU view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN YOU view the title element
YOU WILL find a concise, descriptive title
At the very bottom of the screen, you will find link to the project
